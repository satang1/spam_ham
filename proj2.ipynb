    "In this project, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

    "1. Our logistic regression classifier has a slightly higher prediction accuracy than the zero-prediction classifier since our logistic accuracy is about 75.6% whereas our zero-prediction classifier got about 74.47%. But just looking at these two numbers it seems that there isn't much of a difference between using the word features and not using the word features because the accuracy percentage between the two classifiers are so close (and this likely indicates that our chosen words features are bad). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The words that we have chosen to use are ['drug', 'bank', 'prescription', 'memo', 'private'], and these words are not very indicative of which emails could be spam and which could be ham. That is, we can get either of these words in both kinds of emails, and thus they are not that useful in predicting/classifying email types. Rather, trigger words may be more useful and would indicate an email is spam (and not ham) could be the following: \"click here\", \"be your own boss\", \"best deal\", \"free\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I would still prefer the word classifer over the zero-prediction classifier because I would like to know the metrics of recall, and evaulate how many of the labeled positive items are actually correctly labeled positive. This way, I can get a sense of what proportion of classified true and what proportion of classifed negative are actually correct. But if I use the zero-prediction classifier, I would not be able to use the recall evaluation metric since it will always predict 0%, and I would not be able to figure out how many are correctly labled ham (TN), since it would aways be 100% (cuz proportion of correct ham over all predicted hams: TN/ (TN + FP) == 1)).\n",

    "With this in mind, it is now your task to make the spam filter more accurate. In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the test set. To see your accuracy on the test set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `test` DataFrame and upload your predictions to Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kaggle limits you to four submissions per day**. This means you should start early so you have time if needed to refine your model. You will be able to see your accuracy on the entire set when submitting to Kaggle (the accuracy that will determine your score for question 10).\n",

    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!' were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number / percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust parameters of your model (e.g. the regularization parameter) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ou may use whatever method you prefer in order to create features, but **you are not allowed to import any external feature extraction libraries**. In addition, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models**. No random forests, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not provided any code to do this, so feel free to create as many cells as you need in order to tackle this task. However, answering questions 7, 8, and 9 should help guide you.\n",

    "1. To look for better features, I visualized several bar/count plots and distplots using seaborn to see the difference between spam and ham emails for that specific feature. For instance, when I visualized the distribution/proportion of message length in emails for spam and ham, I realized that if the email length was over 3000 words long, then it was mostly likly a spam email (I also compared statistics to determine this too (i.e. mean lengths)). Another thing I did was read through some of the spam emails (including the subject descriptions) to look for any patterns or unusual features (things that stand out), so that I could use the distinction/feature as a way to differentiate between spam and ham. Just simply by reading the emails and the subject lines, I found that most spam emails have a lot of weird/uncommon punctuation (sometimes all in a row)--(i.e. $, ###, %, {}, <>, etc.). These details were very helpful in differentiating between emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In my process of looking for better features, I realized that certain features didn't improve the accuracy rate as much as I had hoped. For example, if you use the number of \"<>\" in an email message as a feature, the improvement wasn't significant at all, and in fact, could sometimes lower the accuracy rate (depending on the combination of features). But expanding on this, I was able to determine a feature that did work--the number of special characters (i.e. sum of the total number of $, #, <>, {}, etc. charactes that appear in the message string). Though, what worked especially well, (more so than just the sum of special characters) was including a threshold value. For instance, if the sum of special characters was greater than 70 in the email message, it was more likely to be a spam email. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What I found that was the most surprising in my search for good features was that the thresholding method (i.e. the total number of \"something\" is greater than/less than \"some number\") works really well in improving the accuracy rate of my score. For instance, adding the feature \"greater than thresh\" (i.e. whether the total length of email message was greater than 3000) drastically improved my score by around 2-3% as compared to simply using the total length of the email message. This is the same for several other features, such as the special character theshold, and the capital letters threshold. Thresholding the features of certain counts/percentages changes the feature into an indicator value of either 0 or 1, and adds more value to my feature matrix than simply the count/percentage feature itself."

    "### Question 9: Precision-Recall Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "We can trade off between precision and recall. In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, [plot a precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#plot-the-precision-recall-curve) for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle).\n",
